# Dark Mode for Canvas (NUS VERSION)
This extension adds a dark mode for canvas and is forked from [canvas-dark-mode](https://github.com/DeGrandis/canvas-dark-mode). 

The orginal extension is available on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/canvas-dark-mode/jbfgmfpakhabhhpefblmehnadjjkadna?utm_source=chrome-ntp-icon). However, due to delays in releasing in that version with support for NUS, a fork has been created to support NUS. 


**This copy will be deleted once the official version is updated - but my retinas can't wait for that**

## Installation
